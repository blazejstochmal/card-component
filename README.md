# card-component
This is a solution to front-end mentor challenge <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62">Card component</a><br/>
I was working on it for a few hours, to make it look as good as I am able to do now, and keep clean code. <br />
In this project I was focusing on using SCSS as you can check it. <br />
The website is adapted to be well-visible at desktop and mobile phones.
